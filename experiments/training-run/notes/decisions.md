# decisions.md — running log

Pilot outcomes and design decisions land here first, then close their
`OPEN(n)` markers in `specs/02-training-run.md` (same PR).

## 2026-07-16 — TRAIN-1 (run-1 infrastructure)

- `geode.train` implemented under the four-stage protocol; full account in
  `docs/impl-logs/TRAIN-1.md`.
- Stage-model split for this and future non-escalated tasks: fable only
  for TEST-AUDITOR + CONFORMANCE-REVIEWER; writer=opus, implementer=sonnet.
- Tie rule pinned in spec §6.1: converged wins over max_steps on the same
  final-step eval.
- Guard added: `train_full` raises `ValueError` when
  `len(train_seqs) < batch_size` (reviewer-found silent infinite loop).
- Config placeholders shipped for run 1; **do not spend** until OPEN(11)
  (pretrain hyperparams + tokenizer) and OPEN(8) (pretrain vs external
  checkpoint — mentor) are closed.

## 2026-07-17 — dataset generation redesigned (owner, this session)

Datasets are now **generated once by a script and frozen to files**, then
uploaded to HF; they are **not** regenerated from a seed at train time. Full
implementation brief: `notes/dataset-generation.md`. Key decisions:

- **`geode.arith` does not generate data.** It holds only the tested-core
  pieces whose silent failure would waste GPU budget or invalidate the arm
  comparison: rendering (`formats`), the random-label rule (`labels`), evals
  (`evals`), and artifact validators (`validate`). The sampler lives in the
  script `scripts/make_data.py`.
- **Sizes:** 1,000,000 examples per training dataset, 1024 probe. Three
  distinct training files: `D_algo` (run 2, NL, add/sub, correct labels),
  `D_inst` (runs 3+4, operator, mult, random labels), `D_target` (runs 5+6,
  operator, add/sub, correct labels). Runs 3/4 and 5/6 share one file each.
- **NL format (`D_algo`):** `"What is the sum of {a} and {b}? {answer}"` and
  `"What is the difference between {a} and {b}? {answer}"` (= a − b, negatives
  allowed). Operator format unchanged: `"{a} + {b} = {answer}"` etc.
- **Uniqueness = the question.** Every training example has a unique rendered
  question (ordered `a op b`; `(3,5,+) ≠ (5,3,+)`). Answers may repeat. **Zero
  repeated questions** in any dataset.
- **Stratification:** 16 `(x_digits, y_digits)` cells for x,y ∈ {1,2,3,4}.
  Aim even (62,500/cell). Cells whose unique-question capacity is below target
  take **all** their unique questions; the deficit is redistributed to cells
  with spare capacity, **biased toward bigger-number cells**. Total stays
  exactly 1M, no repeats. (Even is infeasible: 1×1 has only 162 add/sub
  questions, 81 mult.)
- **Probe exclusion = question-level (triple `(a, op, b)`), format-independent.**
  A probe example blocks only that exact arithmetic triple from training, not
  the operand pair across other ops, not the commuted twin. Softens the
  original pair-level V5.1. Justification: both arms train on the identical
  `D_target`, so probe overlap inflates both arms' absolute accuracy equally
  and never biases the A-vs-B comparison. Probe questions are carved out first;
  training draws from the remainder. (Probe is add/sub only, so it constrains
  `D_algo`/`D_target`; `D_inst` (mult) is unaffected.)
- **Random labels (`D_inst`):** digit-count and sign matched to the true
  answer, seeded by `(seed, index)`, independent of operands beyond that shape
  (OPEN(6) default). Already implemented in `geode.arith.labels.random_label`.
- **Schema:** tokenizer-agnostic — text + answer **character** span; token span
  derived at load once the tokenizer (OPEN(11)) is fixed.
- **HF upload:** separate script, `--dry-run` default; **owner runs the real
  push**. Dataset repo `Hieuuum/elicit-vs-teach-arith` (owner decision
  2026-07-17); visibility TBD by owner.

Spec-02 §5 deviations to reconcile when this lands (edit the spec in the same
commit): V5.1 pair→triple exclusion; V5.2 now "every question unique, exactly
1M"; V5.3 now 16 (x,y) cells with capacity-aware redistribution (not 256 per
max-digit class); V5.5 new NL wording; generator moved to script land.

## 2026-07-17 — dataset generation implemented (pilot green)

Executed the brief. Tested core + `scripts/make_data.py` rewritten; full suite
(276 tests) green; pilot deterministic (`report.json` and every parquet's
content byte-identical across two runs). Decisions locked this session:

- **Template (closes OPEN(9)).** Both formats share a two-line scaffold
  `Question: <body>` / `Answer: <answer>`. Operator body `a op b`; NL body
  `What is the sum of a and b?` / `What is the difference between a and b?`.
  The answer parser now keys off the final `Answer:` (not `=`/`?`); few-shot
  exemplars are separated by a blank line. Padded length stays OPEN(5) (needs
  the tokenizer, OPEN(11)).
- **Redistribution weight resolved → capacity-capped water-fill.** Owner chose
  "keep every unique question, then distribute evenly if possible" over the
  brief's `x+y` bias. Small cells are taken whole; the remainder splits as
  evenly as capacities allow. Full-scale per-cell result (owner-approved):
  add/sub — six small cells whole (98; 1,556×2; 16,136×3), ten free cells
  94,838–94,839; mult — six tiny + four mid cells whole (81; 810×2; 8,100×3;
  81,000×4), six big cells 108,333–108,334. Total exactly 1,000,000, zero
  repeats. Implemented in `geode.arith.stratify` (V5.3).
- **`allocate`/`capacity` promoted to `geode.arith.stratify`** rather than left
  in the script: silent failure would corrupt stratification, so per the
  promotion rule it is tested core (property test `tests/arith/test_stratify.py`).
- **Observation, not yet a decision:** the installer's random labels (`D_inst`)
  coincide with the true answer in ~0.07% of rows at pilot — small cells have
  tiny digit bands (e.g. 1/9 for a 1-digit answer) and `random_label` (OPEN(6)
  default) does not exclude the true answer. Negligible for "don't teach
  arithmetic," but flag if a strict always-wrong guarantee is wanted (a
  resample-on-collision tweak to `labels.py`).

## Open at the moment

OPEN(1)–OPEN(11): see spec 02 §12 table. Still open for the dataset:
- `--scale full` run not yet executed — awaiting owner sign-off on the pilot
  distribution above (then a few minutes CPU).
- HF dataset repo named `Hieuuum/elicit-vs-teach-arith` (visibility TBD); the
  uploader script (`--dry-run` default) not yet built. Owner runs the real
  `--push`.
