# decisions.md — running log

Pilot outcomes and design decisions land here first, then close their
`OPEN(n)` markers in `specs/02-training-run.md` (same PR).

## 2026-07-16 — TRAIN-1 (run-1 infrastructure)

- `geode.train` implemented under the four-stage protocol; full account in
  `docs/impl-logs/TRAIN-1.md`.
- Stage-model split for this and future non-escalated tasks: fable only
  for TEST-AUDITOR + CONFORMANCE-REVIEWER; writer=opus, implementer=sonnet.
- Tie rule pinned in spec §6.1: converged wins over max_steps on the same
  final-step eval.
- Guard added: `train_full` raises `ValueError` when
  `len(train_seqs) < batch_size` (reviewer-found silent infinite loop).
- Config placeholders shipped for run 1; **do not spend** until OPEN(11)
  (pretrain hyperparams + tokenizer) and OPEN(8) (pretrain vs external
  checkpoint — mentor) are closed.

## Open at the moment

OPEN(1)–OPEN(11): see spec 02 §12 table.
